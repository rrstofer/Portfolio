### Capstone: Deep Learning X-ray Diffraction Model (_January 2023 – June 2023_)

**Overview:** As part of the UCSB Capstone program, my group and I partnered with the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SLAC SSRL), a division of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, to research and develop a deep learning model capable of classifying the resolution of individual X-ray diffraction shots.

We divided our project into two teams, each focused on a specific aspect of multi-task learning model development. One team developed a CNN for classifying images as single- or multi-lattice, while my team created a CNN to predict image resolution. Using a ResNet-based architecture, both teams achieved significant success in model performance. Our multi-lattice detection  CNN achieved 94% accuracy, and the resolution quantification CNN attained a 0.96 Pearson correlation value on simulated data, with high qualitative performance observed on experimental data. This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in addressing the data rate challenge in protein crystallography.

**Improvements:** If allotted more time, we would have liked to extend our work further by testing our model on more real user data and assessing its performance on both tasks. Furthermore, we could also look into implementing more image artifacts to our simulated data sets to increase the variation in our data.
